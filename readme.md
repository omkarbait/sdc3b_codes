# Notes 

Below are some brief notes on the codes:

1. process_sdc3b.py --> Primary code to read and produce 1D and 2D projections of the submissions. The projections are stored in save_dir as numpy arrays.
2. projection_1D_all_teams.ipynb --> Code to make a single plot of all the teams 1D projected PS. 
3. make_plot_sdc3b.py --> produces the 2D plots for each team separately. Depends on plot_sdc3b_results.py which can be used to modify the plotting parameters.
